# Completion commands

Use a `CompletionCommand` to turn Mamba's validated command registry into a
completion artifact for Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, or Carapace. The registry
contains the command tree and its flags, options, positionals, aliases, and
descriptions, so completion generation stays aligned with parsing and help.

## Use the preset command

Register `CompletionCommand.preset()` in the executor's
command list to use Mamba's built-in generators:

```dart
Future<void> main(List<String> args) => Executor(
  'my-cli',
  'Manage application resources.',
  '1.0.0',
  [CompletionCommand.preset(createFile: null)],
).create().execute(args);
```

The preset creates a `completion` command with `cmp` and `cpt` aliases. It
accepts a required shell positional followed by an optional output path:

```console
my-cli completion bash ./my-cli.bash
my-cli completion powershell ./my-cli.ps1
my-cli completion carapace ./my-cli.yaml
```

When a path is present, its extension must match the selected shell and its
file name must contain the application name:

| Shell | Extension |
| --- | --- |
| `bash` | `.bash` |
| `zsh` | `.zsh` |
| `fish` | `.fish` |
| `powershell` | `.ps1` |
| `carapace` | `.yaml` |

`CompletionCommand.shellInput` and `CompletionCommand.pathInput` expose the
same retained declarations used by the preset. Use them with
`ParsedInputs.valueOf` when extending or testing the command.

## Replace destination handling

Pass a callback through the required named `createFile` parameter when another
system should handle the validated destination:

```dart
final completion = CompletionCommand.preset(
  createFile: (path, contents) => print('Write ${contents.length} bytes to $path'),
);
```

The command always generates the script and hands the callback both the
validated `path` and the generated `contents`; the callback owns the write.
`path` is an empty string when the optional path positional was omitted, and
the default writer rejects that case rather than inventing a destination.
Extend `CompletionCommand` when custom handling also needs access to the
registry. Its shell and path declarations remain intrinsic to the command.

## Build a custom completion command

The executor assigns `registryRecord` before execution. Select the converter
for the requested output and call `convert()`:

```dart
final content = switch (shell) {
  ShellCompletion.bash =>
    ToBashCompletionConverter(registryRecord).convert(),
  ShellCompletion.zsh => ToZshCompletionConverter(registryRecord).convert(),
  ShellCompletion.fish =>
    ToFishCompletionConverter(registryRecord).convert(),
  ShellCompletion.powershell =>
    ToPowerShellCompletionConverter(registryRecord).convert(),
  ShellCompletion.carapace => CarapaceSpecConverter(registryRecord).convert(),
};
```

## Inspect the registry record

Treat `registryRecord` as an immutable typed description, not a map. The root
is a `RegistryRecord`; its `commands` recursively contain `RegistryCommand`
objects. Nullable collections mean that the command has no entries of that
kind, so traverse them with `?? const []`.

### `RegistryCommand`

A `RegistryCommand` is one command-tree node. Use:

- `name` for its canonical command token and `aliases` for equivalent tokens;
- `description` for its combined short and optional long help text;
- `commands` for direct children;
- `positionals` and `variadic` for ordered and post-`--` values;
- `flags`, `options`, `optionGroups`, and `accessors` for its named inputs; and
- `persistentFlags` and `persistentOptions` for inputs that converters should
  carry into descendants.

Build the command path while recursing through `commands`. Records produced by
`CommandRegistry.toRecord()` already place effective inherited inputs in each
command's `flags`, `options`, and `accessors`; their `persistentFlags` and
`persistentOptions` are left `null`, so a manually built record is the only way
to state them. `optionGroups` carries both kinds of group: a paired set and a
selected set, so a selected group no longer arrives as members that merely
look independent.

### `RegistryPositional`

List order determines the parse position. `name` and `description` provide
display text, while `required` distinguishes mandatory from discretionary
values. Offer `choices` directly when present. `defaultValue` is textual,
`pattern` contains the validation expression, and `repeatable == true` pairs
with `times` to describe the maximum number of values the positional accepts.

### `RegistryFlag`

`name` and `short` omit their leading dashes. `defaultValue` and `negatable`
describe boolean flags; both are `null` for flag kinds without boolean
semantics. A negatable flag also has a `--no-<name>` spelling. Suppress an
entry when `hidden` is true and use `description` as candidate help text.

### `RegistryOption`

Use `name`, `short`, `hidden`, and `description` for spelling and display.
`required`, `repeatable`, and `unique` describe cardinality. Interpret
`valueType` as `string`, `int`, `double`, or `choice`, then use the applicable
validation metadata:

- offer `choices` as finite candidates;
- treat `defaultValue` as text, including comma-separated list defaults;
- retain `pattern` for string validation; and
- use `min`, `max`, and `step` for bounded numeric candidates.

`pairedOptions` names every member of the same all-or-nothing paired group.

### `RegistryOptionGroup`

`members` lists the option names in one `PairedOptions` or `SelectedOptions`
declaration. A paired group is all-or-nothing: supplying one member requires
all members, and `required` controls whether the whole group may be omitted. A
selected group requires at least one member when `required` is true, and
accepts at most one when `single` is true. All members also appear in `options`.
In registry-produced records, a member's `pairedOptions` is empty for a
selected group and lists the partners for a paired group. Infer the group
kind from that metadata; `single: false` alone does not distinguish them.
The current converters preserve these relationships in the record but do not
enforce group selection or exclusivity in shell completions.

### `RegistryAccessor`

Switch on `kind` before reading variant fields:

- A `group` has `name`, `hidden`, `description`, and recursive `options`.
- A `value` has `name`, `valueType`, `description`, `choices`, `defaultValue`,
  and `pattern`.

Join ancestor and leaf names with `.` to form the long spelling. For example,
the `certificate` value below `server` and `tls` becomes
`--server.tls.certificate`. A hidden group hides its descendant leaves.

The unnamed `CompletionCommand` constructor accepts destination handling,
long description, and aliases, not custom positionals or options. Read its
retained `shellInput` and `pathInput` handles in an override. Access
`registryRecord` during `run`, after the executor initializes the command tree.
